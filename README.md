# Making community resources more accessible

Many community resources are discoverable online only in a basic list form. These lists typically include a link to a website and a basic description of the resource, possibly an address or phone number.

While more information about these resources is typically available, getting that information can be cognitively challening and time-consuming. This project seeks to aggregate more information to make these kinds of resources more useful.
